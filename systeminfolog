systeminfo` is a command that shows complete details about your computer.  
When you open CMD and type `systeminfo`, it shows information like:
- Which version of Windows you have  
- How much RAM is installed  
- What processor you're using  
- When your system was installed  
- BIOS version and many other details

If you want to save all this info in a file, just type:
```
systeminfo > SysteminfoLog.txt
```
It will create a file with all the system information inside.
